# Hotel-Booking-Classification

## Abstract

The pupouse of this project is to predict the booking that were canceled or not using Classification algorithms. 
We worked with data provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mojtaba142/hotel-booking).

## Design
This project originates from the Data Science Bootcamp (T5) to predict booking that were canceled or not through Classification.

## Data
The dataset contains 119390 observations and 36 columns.
About target column (is canceled) have two classes:
|| Class 1 | Class 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0 (was not canceled)` | `1 (was canceled)` | 
| 75166 | 44224 |

## Algorithms

#### - ***Feature engineering:***
Change Type for some features.
Create new features.
Concat many features.

hotel, meal, market_segment, distribution_channel, assigned_room_type, deposit_type, customer_type, reservation_status, guest_location.
#### - ***Data Processing:***
Cleaning the data from duplicate, outliers and nulls.
Handel incorrect value
