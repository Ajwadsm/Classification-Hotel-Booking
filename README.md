# Classification-Hotel-Booking

# Description:
This project about Hotel Booking dataset to do EDA and predict the booking that were canceled or not using Classification algorithms.
This dataset contains observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including booking that effectively arrived.
The dataset provided by Kaggle website: 'https://www.kaggle.com/mojtaba142/hotel-booking'


# Question/need:
1-Select what year was the most reservation in?
2-What is the cancellation rate for each hotel?
3-What is the month in which there were the most cancellations, and what is the month in which there were the least cancellations?
4-Is the number of changes of the reservation affected by (market_segment)?
5-Is booking changes affected by deposit type or by days in waiting list?
6-How many hotel reservation in weekend night vs week nights?


# Data Description:
This dataset contains 119390 observations and 36 columns.


# Goal:
The goal of this project is:
Predict if someone canceled the reservation or not by using Classification algorithms.
About target column (is canceled) have two classes:
|| Class 1 | Class 2 |
| --- | --- 
| `0 (was not canceled)` | `1 (was canceled)` |
| 75166 | 44224 | 

# Tools:
-Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation.
-Scikit-learn for modeling.
-Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting.
-Tableau for interactive visualizations.
-Sklearn for linear regression.
- Xgboost.
